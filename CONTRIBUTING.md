## Code of Conduct

Please help keep this project open and inclusive. Refer to the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before your first contribution.

## How can I Contribute?

This project provides a common configuration setting for `semantic-release` to use between other projects. Consider carefully how a change might impact other projects. Remember, if you need a different setting, anything you put in your local [configuration file](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/usage/configuration#configuration-file) will override these extensions.

[Bug reports or documentation requests](https://github.com/M-Scott-Lassiter/semantic-release-github-npm-config/issues) are welcome. If you have the question, chances are someone else will also who isn't as willing to speak up as you are.

_For security related issues, see the [security policy](https://github.com/M-Scott-Lassiter/jest-geojson/security/policy)._

### Submit a Pull Request

Good pull requests are outstanding help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid unrelated commits.

To submit a pull request,

1. Fork and clone the repository
1. Create a branch for your edits
1. Make sure your work follows the [commits](#commits) guidance

## Development

### Local Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/M-Scott-Lassiter/semantic-release-github-npm-config.git
cd semantic-release-github-npm-config
npm install
npm run build # make sure the development scripts work
```

### Project Structure

The `index.js` contains the release settings. Inside `package.json` is a "release" key that refers to this file for this repository's own use of `semantic-release`.

The table of contents in this guide and the main README are automatically generated using [`markdown-toc`](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/markdown-toc). To generate, run:

```bash
npm run tableofcontents
```

## Commits

All commits to this project use an extension of the angular style. See the [COMMIT_GUIDANCE.md](/../../blob/main/COMMIT_GUIDANCE.md) for details.
